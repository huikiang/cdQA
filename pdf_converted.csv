', 'BUSINESS GROWTH AND RISE IN INCOME  ', 'The business of BNP Paribas was up this quarter in the three operating divisions with in particular a gradual upturn in the business of CIB. Economic growth slowed down in Europe but remained positive. After the crisis in the markets at the end of 2018, the market context remained lacklustre at the beginning of the quarter, but improved towards the end of the period.  Revenues, at 11,144 million euros, were up by 3.2% compared to the first quarter 2018 (+3.9% at constant scope and exchange rates).  The revenues of the operating divisions were up by 4.4% with a slight decrease at Domestic Markets1 (-0.2%) where the low interest rate environment was not fully offset by good business development, in particular in the specialised businesses, but a significant rise at International Financial Services (+9.5%) as a result of good business development and an increase at CIB (+3.5%) due to the gradual upturn in customer activity.  At 8,449 million euros, the Group’s operating expenses were up by 2.3% compared to the first quarter 2018 (+1.4% at constant scope and exchange rates) generating a positive jaws effect. They included the exceptional 206 million euro impact of the businesses’ transformation costs and acquisitions’ restructuring costs2 (211 million euros in the first quarter 2018).  Operating expenses also included this quarter for 1,139 million euros almost the whole amount of taxes and contributions (including in particular the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund) for the year pursuant to the application of IFRIC 21 Taxes (1,109 million euros in the first quarter 2018). Excluding the impact of IFRIC 21 Taxes, operating expenses were thus up by 2.2% (+1.2% at constant scope and exchange rates).  The operating expenses of the operating divisions rose by 3.1% compared to the first quarter 2018: they were up by 0.4% for Domestic Markets1 with a decrease in the networks and a rise in the specialised businesses related to business development, up by 6.3% for International Financial Services as a result of business growth, and up by 3.1% for CIB.  Operating divisions jaws effect was positive thanks to the implementation, in line with the 2020 plan, of cost saving measures (169 million euros in savings generated this quarter for a total of 1,324 million euros since the launch of the programme in early 2017).  The gross operating income of the Group thus totalled 2,695 million euros, up by 6.2% (+12.5% at constant scope and exchange rates). It was up by 7.9% for the operating divisions.  The cost of risk, at 769 million euros, was up by 25.0% compared to the first quarter 2018. This increase resulted from provision write-backs at CIB and Personal Finance during the same period last year. At 38 basis points of outstanding customer loans, the cost of risk was at a low level reflecting in particular the good control of risk at loan origination, the low interest rate environment and the continued improvement in Italy.  The Group’s operating income, at 1,926 million euros (1,923 million euros in the first quarter 2018), was up by 0.2% (+8.0% at constant scope and exchange rates).

They included in the first quarter 2018 the +101 million euros impact of the capital gain from the sale of a building.  Pre-tax income came to 2,683 million euros (2,256 million euros in the first quarter 2018) and was thus up by 18.9%.    The average corporate tax rate was 23.3%, due in particular to the low tax rate on the capital gain from the sale of SBI Life shares.  The Group’s net income attributable to equity holders was thus 1,918 million euros, up by 22.4% compared to the first quarter 2018 (2,565 million euros excluding exceptional items1 and the impact of IFRIC 21 Taxes, virtually stable at -0.2%).   The return on equity excluding exceptional items was thus 9.7%. The return on tangible equity excluding exceptional items came to 11.2%.   As at 31 March 2019, the common equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.7% (-10 bp compared to  31 December 2018 due to the impact of the new accounting standard IFRS 16 and the postponement to the coming quarters of the securitisations scheduled this quarter) and the leverage ratio2 came to 4.2%. Lastly, the Group’s immediately available liquidity reserve was  335 billion euros, equivalent to over one year of room to manoeuvre in terms of wholesale funding.

Operating expenses totalled 641 million euros and rose by 4.4% compared to the first quarter 2018 (+3.7% excluding the impact of IFRIC 21) due in particular to business development at Wealth Management in Germany and industrialisation costs in Asset Management.

Securities Services revenues, at 516 million euros, were basically stable (-0.1%) compared to the first quarter 2018 in the light of a slight decrease in the number of transactions  (-0.4% compared to the first quarter 2018) and the deferred impact of new mandates. Assets under custody and administration were up sharply by 7.6% compared to 31 March 2018 (+1.1% on average during the quarter) due in particular to the successful migration of the $180bn in assets of Janus Henderson at the end of March and the recovery in the markets at the end of the quarter.

In case of acquired or created entity, the results of the new entity are eliminated from the constant scope results of current-year periods corresponding to the periods when the entity was not owned in the prior-year. In case of divested entities, the entity's results are excluded symmetrically for the prior year for quarters when the entity was not owned. In case of change of consolidation method, the policy is to use the lowest consolidation percentage over the two years (current and prior) for results of quarters adjusted on a like-for-like basis.   Comparative analysis at constant exchange rates are prepared by restating results for the prior-year quarter (reference quarter) at the current quarter exchange rate (analysed quarter).

The fully loaded Basel 3 common equity Tier 1 ratio2 was 11.8% as at 31 December 2017, up by  30 basis points compared to 31 December 2016, primarily due to the year’s net income after taking into account the 50% dividend pay-out ratio (+60bp)  and the rise in risk-weighted assets excluding the scope and foreign exchange effect (-30bp). The foreign exchange is, on the whole, limited on the ratio along with the effect of main acquisitions and sales, the effect in particular of the acquisition in the fourth quarter 2017 of the financing activities of General Motors Europe (-10 bp) offsetting the effect of the sale in the first quarter 2017 of First Hawaiian Bank (+10 bp).

Leveraging on the Group’s integrated and diversified model, this plan is based on an ambitious transformation programme in all the operating divisions as well as differentiated business development strategies between Domestic Markets, IFS and CIB in compliance with a strict corporate social and environmental policy.   Good start of the ambitious programme of new customer experiences, digital transformation and savings  The Group is implementing in all the operating divisions an ambitious transformation programme that aims at the same time to implement new customer experiences, speed up digital transformation and improve the operating efficiency.  Five levers are thereby implemented throughout the Group to reinvent the customer experience and build a more effective and digital bank: (1) implement new customer journeys (new digitalised, value-added and personalised customer services and journeys that were illustrated in particular this year by the launch of LyfPay, a universal mobile payment solution, the acquisition of Compte-Nickel and the development of the online platform Centric at CIB); (2) upgrade the operational model by streamlining processes, simplifying organisations and developing shared platforms with, for example, the announcement this year of the roll-out of the BlackRock’s Aladdin platform at Asset Management; (3) adapt information systems by incorporating in particular new technologies in order to speed up the digital transformation and by promoting agile work practices, which entails the development of Data Hubs to interface between banking and digital platforms; (4) make better use of data to serve clients all the whilst bolstering data storage and data analysis capacities: the acquisition this year of Gambit in the robo-advisory field will contribute to this objective;  (5) develop more digital, collaborative and agile work practices, which translated this year in particular in an equity investment in Symphony, a secure and automated communication platform at Global Markets.  The Group plans to invest 3 billion euros between 2017 and 2019 in this programme that will generate 3.4 billion euros in savings during the same period and 2.7 billion euros in annual recurring savings starting from 2020 with a balanced contribution of all the divisions.                                                             1 Excluding valuation reserves (Group share) ', '2 Including valuation reserves (Group share) ', '3 Taking into account all the rules of the CRD4 directives with no transitory provisions.

Differentiated business development strategies successfully implemented by the divisions  ', 'In an interest rate environment that is expected to improve only gradually and given new client expectations influenced by digital usages, Domestic Markets reinforces its sales and marketing drive with new customer experiences, enhanced attractiveness of the offering and new services.  As a growth engine for the Group, International Financial Services strengthens its leading positions in its specialised businesses, accelerates their development (new offerings, new partnerships, new regions) and continues the selective expansion of retail banks.  Lastly, CIB optimises the use of its resources and revenue growth by expanding its corporate and institutional client base, targeting particularly certain countries in Europe, and growing fee-generating businesses, all the while reducing its costs.  These differentiated strategies are successfully implemented in all three operating divisions. The sharp rise in their pre-tax income compared to 2016 illustrates the good evolution of their operating performance (Domestic Markets: +4.7%, IFS: +18.2%, CIB: +14.6%).   Commitment for a positive impact on society  The Group is pursuing an ambitious corporate social and environmental responsibility policy and is committed to making a positive impact on society. It thus created this year a Company Engagement Department, whose head is a member of the Group Executive Committee, in order to reinforce its action in this field. This new Department defines the Group’s commitments to civil society, strengthens CSR practices and makes all the company’s levers converge to meet key challenges in society.  The Group aims at financing the economy in an ethical way, promoting the development of its employees, supporting initiatives that have a social impact and playing a major role in the transition toward a low carbon economy. It announced that it will stop funding companies whose principal business activity is gas/oil from shale, oil from tar sands or oil/gas production located in the Arctic region. It also announced that it will stop the financings to tobacco companies. It originated and placed sustainable bonds for an equivalent of 6 billion U.S. dollars (+116% compared to 2016).  This policy committed for a positive impact on society is recognised by very good rankings in major specialised indices (named for example first bank in Europe in terms of CSR by Global Banking & Finance Review).

It aims at a return on equity above 10% in 2020 with a 12%1 CET1 ratio. The dividend pay-out ratio was increased this year to 50%, in line with the plan.   * *     *   Commenting on these results, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafé stated:  “With 7.8 billion euros in net income, BNP Paribas delivered a good performance in 2017, thanks to its integrated and diversified model in service of clients.

The underlying purpose of the calculation is to facilitate period-on-period comparisons.   In case of acquired or created entity, the results of the new entity are eliminated from the constant scope results of current-year periods corresponding to the periods when the entity was not owned in the prior-year. In case of divested entities, the entity's results are excluded symmetrically for the prior year for quarters when the entity was not owned. In case of change of consolidation method, the policy is to use the lowest consolidation percentage over the two years (current and prior) for results of quarters adjusted on a like-for-like basis.   Comparative analysis at constant exchange rates are prepared by restating results for the prior-year quarter (reference quarter) at the current quarter exchange rate (analysed quarter).

The meeting was chaired by  Jean Lemierre and the Board examined the Group’s results for the fourth quarter and endorsed the 2018 financial statements.  ', 'GOOD RESILIENCE OF INCOME  ', 'The business of BNP Paribas was up in 2018 with higher outstanding loans in the context of economic growth in Europe. The revenue evolution was however penalised by the still low interest rate environment and an unfavourable financial market context with particularly challenging conditions at the end of the year.  Revenues totalled 42,516 million euros, down by 1.5% compared to 2017 which included exceptional items: +233 million euros in capital gains from the sale of Shinhan and Euronext shares and -175 million euros in Own Credit Adjustment (OCA) and own credit risk included in derivatives (DVA).  In the operating divisions, revenues were down by 0.9% (-0.4% at constant scope and exchange rates): they were down slightly at Domestic Markets1 (-0.2%) due to the low interest rate environment partly offset by good business development, in particular in the specialised businesses; up at International Financial Services (+3.4%), despite an unfavourable foreign exchange effect (+6.6% at constant scope and exchange rates2); but down at CIB (-7.5%) due to a lacklustre market context and very challenging conditions at the end of the year, notwithstanding good development with targeted customers.  At 30,583 million euros, the Group’s operating expenses were up by 2.1% compared to 2017. They included the exceptional 1,235 million euro impact of businesses’ transformation costs and acquisitions’ restructuring costs3 (957 million euros in 2017). Excluding these exceptional items, they rose by only 1.2%.  The operating expenses of the operating divisions rose by 1.7% compared to 2017 (+1.7% at constant scope and exchange rates): they were up by 0.8% for Domestic Markets1 with a rise in the specialised businesses due to business development but down in the domestic networks; up by 5.4% for International Financial Services as a result of business growth support and new product development; but down by 1.3% for CIB due to cost saving measures.  The gross operating income of the Group thus totalled 11,933 million euros, down by 9.7%. It was down by 6.0% for the operating divisions (-4.7% at constant scope and exchange rates).  The cost of risk was down at 2,764 million euros (2,907 million euros in 2017). It was 35 basis points of outstanding customer loans. This low level reflects in particular the good control of risk at loan origination, the low interest rate environment and the continued improvement in Italy.  The Group’s operating income, at 9,169 million euros (10,310 million euros in 2017), was thus down by 11.1%. It was down by 6.4% for the operating divisions (-5.5% at constant scope and exchange rates).  Non-operating items totalled 1,039 million euros (1,000 million euros in 2017). They included the exceptional +101 million euro impact of the capital gain from the sale of a building and the  +286 million euro capital gain from the sale of First Hawaiian Bank shares. Last year, they included a +326 million euro capital gain realised from the initial public offering of SBI Life as well as the full impairment of TEB’s goodwill for -172 million euros.                                                             1 Including 100% of Private Banking in the domestic networks (excluding PEL/CEL effects) ', '2 Excluding the impact of the drop in markets at the end of the year in Insurance on assets at market value ', '3 In particular, LaSer, DAB Bank, GE LLD, ABN Amro Luxembourg and Raiffeisen Bank Polska    3 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018  Pre-tax income, which came to 10,208 million euros (11,310 million euros in 2017), was thus down by 9.7%. It was down by 8.6% for the operating divisions (-5.3% at constant scope and exchange rates).  The average tax rate was 23.1%, benefitting in particular from a decrease in the corporate tax rate in Belgium and in the United States and from the low tax rate on the long term capital gain from amongst others the sale of First Hawaiian Bank shares.  The Group’s net income attributable to equity holders was 7,526 million euros, down by 3.0% compared to 2017 but by only 1.4%, at 8,036 million euros, excluding the effect of exceptional items1.   Noteworthy that net income reflected the spot impact, at the closing date, of the sharp fall in the markets on the revaluation of the residual stake in First Hawaiian Bank2 and on some insurance portfolios (-220 million euros).  The return on equity was thus 8.2% (8.8% excluding exceptional items). The return on tangible equity came to 9.6% (10.2% excluding exceptional items). Earnings per share was €5.73.  As at 31 December 2018, the fully loaded Basel 3 common equity Tier 1 ratio3 was 11.8% (stable compared to 31 December 2017 despite the -20 bp technical adjustment as at 1st January 2018 related to the full application of IFRS 9 and to an amended prudential treatment of irrevocable payment commitments). The fully loaded Basel 3 leverage ratio4 came to 4.5% and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio to 132%. Lastly, the Group’s immediately available liquidity reserve was 308 billion euros, equivalent to over one year of room to manoeuvre in terms of wholesale funding.  The net book value per share reached 74.7 euros, equivalent to a compound annual growth rate of 5.0% since 31 December 2008, illustrating the continuous value creation throughout the cycle.  The Board of Directors will propose to shareholders at the Shareholders’ Meeting to pay a €3.02 dividend per share (stable compared to 2017), payable in cash.  The Group is actively implementing its 2020 plan. It is pursuing an ambitious policy of engagement in society with significant initiatives to promote ethical responsibility, social and environmental innovation and a low carbon economy while strengthening its internal control and compliance system.

This ratio also recorded as at 1st January 2018 the impact of -10 bp of the supervisor’s new general requirement to deduct irrevocable payment commitments from the prudential capital and thus came to 11.6% pro forma as at 1st January 2018.  It rose back to 11.8% as at 31 December 2018, or an increase of 20 bp compared to 1st January 2018 which breaks down between:   ', '- the net income for the year (excluding capital gain on the sale of 43.6% of First Hawaiian Bank) after taking into account dividend payment (+50 bp),   ', '- the increase in risk weighted assets, in particular in Domestic Markets and Personal Finance, excluding foreign exchange effect and operational risk (-20 bp),   ', '- the risk-weighted assets related to operational risk brought to the standard method level  (-10 bp)  ', '- the other effects which have a negligible impact on the ratio overall (including the effects of the acquisitions and sales of the year).

Leveraging on its integrated and diversified business model, the Group is successfully implementing its digital transformation and pursues differentiated business development strategies in Domestic Markets, International Financial Services (IFS) and CIB, all the while resolutely committing for a positive impact on society.   A trajectory in line with the plan for Domestic Markets and IFS but need to accelerate transformation at CIB  In line with its mid-term plan objectives, Domestic Markets confirms its 2020 ambitions. In an interest rate environment that is expected to improve only gradually and with new expectations from customers influenced by digital uses, the operating division will continue to strengthen its sales and marketing drive while improving the customer experience and offering new services. It will intensify its cost reduction measures with an additional savings programme of 150 million euros compared to the initial objective. It will continue adapting its branch network, creating omni-channel customer service centres and rolling out end-to-end digitalised processes. It will continue its rigorous risk management policy with in particular the continued improvement of the risk profile of BNL bc for which it confirms the cost of risk target of 50 basis points in 2020.  The operating division thus confirms its 2020 trajectory with a revenue evolution slightly above initial expectations, an upcoming significant improvement of the operating efficiency generating a positive jaws effect (decrease in the cost income ratio in the networks and virtually stable in the specialised businesses) and a confirmation of the plan’s RONE1 target.  Despite an unfavourable foreign exchange effect, IFS likewise presents a 2020 trajectory in line with the plan and confirms its role as a growth engine for the Group. The operating division will thus continue its sustained growth, consolidating its leading positions in the businesses thanks to the quality of its product offering, pursuing its digital transformation, continuing the selective development of retail banking outside the Eurozone, strengthening cooperation with the Group and executing the integration of acquisitions made recently. It will intensify cost saving measures with a programme of an additional 120 million euros in savings compared to the initial objective, continuing the industrialisation and pooling of processes, the streamlining of certain product offerings and the implementation of digital initiatives.  IFS thus confirms its 2020 trajectory with a revenue growth in line with the plan, thanks to a good business drive and acquisitions made, and a significant improvement of the operating efficiency (leading to a positive jaws effect as early as 2019) but less however than expected initially due mainly to the unfavourable foreign exchange effect. The RONE1 will reach a level close to the target.  In the face of an unfavourable environment, CIB is intensifying its transformation. Despite the successes recorded both in terms of gains of new clients and cost savings (down for the third year in a row) and of containment of allocated capital (-6.3% since 2016), the operating division is                                                            1 Pre-tax return on notional equity    20 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018 confronted with a decrease of the global revenue pool in the CIB industry and a decrease in its profitability with a 12.9% RONE1 this year (-3.2 points compared to 2017).  CIB thus announces three-pronged structural actions to improve a profitability that deviated from the 2020 trajectory.  (1) review of non-strategic, subscale or unprofitable business segments (e.g. stopped Opera Trading Capital’s proprietary business and commodity derivatives in the United States); analysis of certain peripheral locations and rationalisation of the relationship with clients who are sub-profitable. The preliminary scope of potential exits could represent revenues in the range of 200 to 300 million euros for a cost income ratio above 100% and 5 billion euros in risk-weighted assets.  (2) intensification of the industrialisation to reduce costs with in particular the adaptation of the flow businesses to the fast electronisation of the financial markets at Global Markets, the development of shared platforms at Corporate Banking, the industrialisation of the multi-local operations model at Securities Services and the streamlining and mutualising of IT and back offices. CIB thus increases its recurring savings programme by 350 million euros to bring it to 850 million euros2 over 2019 and 2020.  (3) Priority given to even more selective and profitable growth with in particular reinforced cooperation between the businesses (e.g. expansion of the joint Corporate Banking and Global Markets platform to develop the Originate & Distribute policy), the implementation of targeted measures at Global Markets to turn around the performances of the forex and the equity derivatives businesses, the continuation of development at Corporate Banking in targeted countries in Europe and the selective growth in America and Asia, and the integration of the acquisitions made at Securities Services.  The operating division thus focuses on profitable growth to be the preferred European partner of its clients by continuing to strengthen its leading positions in Europe and selective development in the United States and Asia, and deepening the integrated model between the businesses and the regions (“One Bank”).  CIB is thereby adjusting its 2020 trajectory, with a downward revision of its revenue target (expected to be up however compared to a weak 2018 base), a significant improvement of operating efficiency enabling to generate a positive jaws effect thanks to additional cost saving efforts, stable risk-weighted assets in 2020 compared to 2016 (compared to a 2% increase per year3 in the initial plan) and a rise in the RONE1 to a level close to the initial objective.   Significant progress in the digital transformation  The Group is successfully implementing in all the operating divisions its ambitious transformation programme designed to implement new customer experiences, accelerate digitalisation and improve operating efficiency.  Digital is strongly growing in all the businesses. Domestic Markets already has over 8 million digital clients in retail banking (of which 3 million at Hello bank! and 1.1 million at Nickel) and accelerates mobile uses of individual customers thanks to expanded features available, ranking as first bank in France in terms of mobile features according to D-rating4. IFS has 0.9 million clients in its digital banks (Cepteteb in Turkey and BZG Optima in Poland) and makes electronic signature widely available (accounting already for 50% of contracts signed at Personal Finance). At CIB, the Centric digital platform is growing rapidly with close to 10,000 customers using it.                                                             1 Pre-tax return on notional equity ', '2 Excluding savings related to businesses exits ', '3 2016-2020 compound annual growth rate ', '4 Agency specialised in digital performance analysis    21 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018 ', 'Robotics and artificial intelligence are developing rapidly with already over 500 robots operational (chatbots, automation of controls, reportings, data processing). Processes are industrialised and optimised everywhere and new end-to-end digitalised customer journeys implemented. Lastly, new digital products are being launched, such as LyfPay, a value-added mobile payment solution, with already 1.3 million downloadings.  The Group is thus successfully implementing its five transformation levers (implement new customer journeys, make better use of data, upgrade the operational model, adapt and mutualise information systems and develop more digital work practices).  The costs associated with this transformation totalled 2 billion euros since last year, in line with the plan. For 2019, the envelope of transformation costs is revised downward by 300 million euros, to 700 million euros versus 1 billion euros initially planned (-10% compared to the 3 billion euro envelope originally planned for the whole plan).  The recurring cost savings generated by the end of 2018 totalled 1.15 billion euros, in line with the objective. Given the higher rise than expected of certain regulatory costs totalling 200 million euros by 2020 and the needed intensification of transformation at CIB, the Group updated its programme with an additional 600 million euros in savings (55% at CIB, 25% at Domestic Markets, 20% at IFS). These additional savings will be achieved in particular thanks to the streamlining of the IT organisation and the use of the cloud, the reinforcement of the industrialisation of the functions with increased use of artificial intelligence, the streamlining of structures through international mutualized competency centers and the optimisation of real estate costs (stepping-up of flex offices, etc.). The 2020 recurring cost savings target is thus raised from 2.7 billion euros to 3.3 billion euros.   Commitment for a positive impact on society  The Group is pursuing out an ambitious corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSR) policy and is committed to making a positive impact on society with concrete impacts.  It thus stopped in 2018 financing companies whose primary business is gas / oil from shale, oil from tar sands or gas / oil production in the Arctic as well as financing tobacco companies. It ranks  number 3 for green bonds and was involved in 15.6 billion euros in financing renewable energies and 1.6 billion euros dedicated to social entrepreneurship.  The Group aims in particular to finance the economy in an ethical way, promote the development of its employees, support initiatives with a social impact and play a major role in the transition toward a low carbon economy. It thereby wants to be a major contributor to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and targets 185 billion euros in 2020 in financing to sectors that contribute to these goals (166 billion euros by the end of 2018).  This policy of engagement to make a positive impact on society is recognised through the bank’s very good rankings in major specialised indices (World’s Best Bank for sustainable finance at the Euromoney Awards for Excellence 2018).  The Group is also a very significant tax payer with a total amount of taxes and levies of 5.6 billion euros in 2018, of which 2.5 billion euros in France.       22 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018 ', '2020 Targets Updated  The Group is updating the plan’s targets with revenue growth during the period 2016-2020 reviewed at 1.5% per year (2.5% per year in the initial plan) and a recurring cost savings target of 3.3 billion euros (2.7 billion euros in the initial plan) from 2020. It expects about 2.5%1 growth of risk-weighted assets per year by 2020 with active management of the balance sheet (sales of non-core equity stakes or assets). The Group thus expects an organic capital generation of at least  30 basis points per year after dividend distribution.  On these bases, the return on equity is expected at 9.5% in 2020 (or a return on tangible equity above 10.5%) with a CET1 ratio equal or above 12%.  The Group thus expects more than 20% growth in the earnings per share between 2016 and 2020 leading to, with a 50% pay-out ratio, an increase of the dividend of 35% during the same period.   * *     *    Commenting on these results, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Laurent Bonnafé stated:  “Thanks to its diversified and integrated model, the Group delivered in 2018 7.5 billion euros in net income. The fully loaded Basel 3 common equity Tier 1 ratio is 11.8%, attesting the high robustness of the balance sheet.  BNP Paribas’ digital transformation plan is being successfully implemented, illustrated by the roll out of numerous new customer experiences. The Group is actively executing its ambitious policy of engagement in society.  The Group is committed to its 2020 ambition and implements further savings to significantly improve operating efficiency in all the operating divisions as early as 2019.”                                                                 1 2018-2020 Compound Annual Growth Rate    23 RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2018   CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT       ', 'BNP Paribas’ financial disclosures for the fourth quarter 2018 and for the year 2018 are contained in this press release and in the presentation attached herewith.

In case of acquired or created entity, the results of the new entity are eliminated from the constant scope results of current-year periods corresponding to the periods when the entity was not owned in the prior-year. In case of divested entities, the entity's results are excluded symmetrically for the prior year for quarters when the entity was not owned. In case of change of consolidation method, the policy is to use the lowest consolidation percentage over the two years (current and prior) for results of quarters adjusted on a like-for-like basis.   Comparative analysis at constant exchange rates are prepared by restating results for the prior-year quarter (reference quarter) at the current quarter exchange rate (analysed quarter).

However, the past year was far from business as usual. Our results were affected by carriage pricing erosion in the enterprise segment and challenging conditions in India and Indonesia. Competition intensified across virtually all our markets as operators jostled for market share while advances in technology continued to disrupt the telco industry, putting more pressure on prices and return on investment. With currency headwinds and the exceptional gain recorded last year from our NetLink Trust divestment, net profit dropped 44% to S$3.1 billion. Our underlying net profit declined 21%. Against this backdrop of tougher industry and business conditions, we stayed the course on digital transformation which puts us in good stead. Our efforts to stay relevant to customers through digitalisation paid off as our core consumer business raised the bar in products and services and customer service standards. The race by governments and enterprises to digitalise their processes and operations also presented new opportunities for our enterprise business, particularly Trustwave and NCS. Having invested in deepening our capabilities in cyber security, cloud, data analytics and IoT, ICT services now constitute 48% of our enterprise revenue. Amid a difficult year, we were financially disciplined and prudent in managing our costs and investments. Our strong free cash flow generation and balance sheet give us one of the strongest credit ratings among telecom companies.             REGIONAL MARKET GROWTH We have a unique regional presence that is of scale. Our positive long-term view of our regional assets and diversification hasn’t changed. While it was a particularly bruising year for India which faced such aggressive competition that only three operators now stand, Airtel has weathered the storm and strengthened its balance sheet with a rights issue to further compete in a consolidated market that remains buoyed by the growth potential of Digital India. Indonesia had a nationwide SIM card registration exercise which affected the industry but the market is now recovering. Globe had a stellar year with robust revenue share growth in mobile and broadband, and AIS continued to lead the market in Thailand. We expect our associates to deliver positive growth fueled by exponential growth in smartphone adoption and a plethora of applications and content. DIFFERENTIATING A RESILIENT CORE    The competitive landscapes in our core markets of Singapore and Australia have changed with more players, including MVNOs, in the industry coupled with increasing capital intensity with 5G rollout expectations. Our businesses will accelerate digitalisation, automation and robotic processes combining AI tools and data analytics to drive productivity, cost savings and better customer experiences. We have differentiated with product innovations, quality content and partnerships that were well-received by customers. We remain committed to providing superior network coverage and connectivity and leading the way to 5G. While 5G spectrum policy is still being finalised in Singapore, we are piloting the island’s first 5G network. In Australia, Optus with its extensive 5G spectrum portfolio became the first carrier to provide high-speed home broadband services on 5G.  DRIVING NEW GROWTH IN DIGITAL As governments race to build smart cities and enterprises future-proof their operations, we will leverage this rising tide of digitalisation to drive growth in our ICT and digital businesses. Both our cyber security business Trustwave and digital marketing arm Amobee, while not yet profitable, have executed their strategies. We are confident they will continue their revenue growth momentum to become leading players.

GENERAL Singtel is domiciled and incorporated in Singapore and is publicly traded on the Singapore Exchange. The address of its registered office is 31 Exeter Road, Comcentre, Singapore 239732. The principal activities of the Company consist of the operation and provision of telecommunications systems and services, and investment holding. The principal activities of the significant subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 44. In Singapore, the Group has the rights to provide fixed national and international telecommunications services to 31 March 2037, and public cellular mobile telephone services to 31 March 2032. In addition, the Group is licensed to offer Internet services and has also obtained frequency spectrum and licence rights to install, operate and maintain mobile communication systems and services including wireless broadband systems and services. The Group also holds the requisite licence to provide nationwide subscription television services. In Australia, Optus is granted telecommunication licences under the Telecommunications Act 1991. Pursuant to the Telecommunications (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1997, the licences continued to have effect after the deregulation of telecommunications in Australia in 1997. The licences do not have a finite term, but are of continuing operation until cancelled under the Telecommunications Act 1997. These financial statements were authorised and approved for issue in accordance with a Directors’ resolution  dated 14 May 2019.', '2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES', '2.1 Basis of Accounting  For all periods up to and including the financial year ended 31 March 2018, the financial statements were prepared in accordance with Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (“FRS”). With effect from 1 April 2018, the Group adopted all applicable new and revised Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) (“SFRS(I)”) and Interpretations of SFRS(I) on a mandatory basis. SFRS(I) are identical to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  The new accounting framework and standards have been retrospectively applied to the financial statements for the previous financial year ended 31 March 2018 and the opening statement of financial position as at 1 April 2017. These are the Group’s first set of financial statements prepared in accordance with SFRS(I), of which SFRS(I) 1, First-time Adoption of Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International) has been applied. The adoption of SFRS(I) has no material effect on the financial statements prepared under FRS, except for SFRS(I) 1, SFRS(I) 9, Financial Instruments, and SFRS(I) 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The summarised impact of adopting  SFRS(I) 1, SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 15 for the previous financial year ended 31 March 2018, and as at 31 March 2018  and 1 April 2017, are shown in Note 42. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost basis, except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act and SFRS(I). Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods and services. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with SFRS(I) requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.', '147', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.1 Basis of Accounting (Cont’d)  Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Critical accounting estimates and assumptions used that are significant to the financial statements, and areas involving a higher degree of judgement are disclosed in Note 3.', '2.2 Foreign Currencies', '2.2.1 Functional and presentation currency  Items included in the financial statements of each entity in the Group are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the “functional currency”). The statement of financial position and statement of changes in equity of the Company and consolidated financial statements of the Group are presented in Singapore Dollar, which is the functional and presentation currency of the Company and the presentation currency of the Group. ', '2.2.2 Transactions and balances Transactions in a currency other than the functional currency (“foreign currency”) are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the date of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the reporting period are translated at exchange rates ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising from translation are recognised in the income statement. ', '2.2.3 Translation of foreign operations’ financial statements In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to Singapore Dollar at exchange rates ruling at the end of the reporting period except for share capital and reserves which are translated at historical rates of exchange (see below for translation of goodwill and fair value adjustments).  Income and expenses in the consolidated income statement are translated using either the average exchange rates for the month or year, which approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. All resulting translation differences are taken directly to ‘Other Comprehensive Income’. On loss of control of a subsidiary, loss of significant influence of an associate or loss of joint control of a joint venture, the accumulated translation differences relating to that foreign operation are reclassified from equity to the consolidated income statement as part of gain or loss on disposal.  On partial disposal where there is no loss of control of a subsidiary, the accumulated translation differences relating to the disposal are reclassified to non-controlling interests. For partial disposals of associates or joint ventures, the proportionate accumulated translation differences relating to the disposal are taken to the consolidated  income statement.', '2.2.4 Translation of goodwill and fair value adjustments Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities completed on or after 1 April 2005 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entities and are recorded in the functional currencies of the foreign entities and translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period. However, for acquisitions of foreign entities completed prior to 1 April 2005, goodwill and fair value adjustments continue to be recorded at the exchange rates at the respective dates of the acquisitions.', 'Singapore Telecommunications Limited  |  Annual Report 2019 148', 'OVERVIEW', 'BU', 'SINESS R', 'EVIEWS', 'GO', 'VERN', 'AN', 'CE A', 'ND SUSTA', 'INA', 'BILITY', 'PERFO', 'RM', 'AN', 'CE', 'FINA', 'NC', 'IALS', 'AD', 'DITIO', 'NA', 'L INFO', 'RM', 'ATION', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.2.5 Net investment in a foreign entity  The exchange differences on loans from the Company to its subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures which form part of the Company’s net investment in the subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures are included in ‘Currency Translation Reserve’ in the consolidated financial statements. On disposal of the foreign entity, the accumulated exchange differences deferred in the ‘Currency Translation Reserve’ are reclassified to the consolidated income statement in a similar manner as described in Note 2.2.3. ', '2.3 Cash and Cash Equivalents For the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, balances with banks and fixed deposits with original maturity of mainly three months or less, net of bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.  Bank overdrafts are included under borrowings in the statement of financial position.', '2.4  Contract Assets Where revenue recognised for a customer contract exceeds the amount received or receivable from a customer, a contract asset is recognised. Contract assets arise from bundled telecommunications contracts where equipment delivered at a point in time are bundled with services delivered over time. Contract assets also arise from information technology contracts where performance obligations are delivered over time (see Note 2.23). Contract assets are transferred to trade receivables when the consideration for performance obligations are billed. Contract assets are included in ‘Trade and other receivables’ under current assets as they are expected to be realised in the normal operating cycle. Contract assets are subject to impairment review for credit risk in accordance with the expected loss model.', '2.5 Trade and Other Receivables Trade and other receivables, including contract assets and receivables from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are initially recognised at fair values and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less an allowance for expected credit loss (“ECL”).  The Group applied the ‘simplified approach’ for determining the allowance for ECL for trade receivables and contract assets, where lifetime ECL are recognised in the income statement at initial recognition of receivables and updated at each reporting date. Lifetime ECL represents the expected credit losses that will result from all possible default events over the expected life of the receivable. When determining the allowance for ECL, the Group considers reasonable and supportable information that is relevant and available for customer types. This includes both qualitative and quantitative information based on the Group’s historical experience and forward looking information such as general economic factors as applicable. Loss events include financial difficulty or bankruptcy of the debtor, significant delay in payments and breaches of contracts.  Trade and other receivables are written off against the allowance for ECL when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are recognised in the income statement.', '2.6 Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated cost of completion and selling expenses.', '149', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.7 Contract Liabilities Where the amounts received or receivable from customers exceed the revenues recognised for contracts, contract liabilities or advance billings are recognised in the statement of financial position. Contract liabilities or advance billings are recognised as revenues when services are provided to customers.', '2.8 Trade and Other Payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. ', '2.9 Borrowings Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. After initial recognition, borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method. ', '2.10 Provisions A provision is recognised when there is a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,  and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. No provision is recognised for future  operating losses.  For information technology contracts, a provision for expected project loss is made when it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract revenue.  Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.', '2.11 Contingencies A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability. Contingent liabilities are not recognised on the statement of financial position of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and for which fair values can be  reliably determined.', '2.12 Group Accounting The accounting policy for investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures in the Company’s financial statements is stated in Note 2.13. The Group’s accounting policy on goodwill is stated in Note 2.19.1.', 'Singapore Telecommunications Limited  |  Annual Report 2019 150', 'OVERVIEW', 'BU', 'SINESS R', 'EVIEWS', 'GO', 'VERN', 'AN', 'CE A', 'ND SUSTA', 'INA', 'BILITY', 'PERFO', 'RM', 'AN', 'CE', 'FINA', 'NC', 'IALS', 'AD', 'DITIO', 'NA', 'L INFO', 'RM', 'ATION', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.12.1 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities (including structured entities) controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has power over the entity, is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns by using its power over the entity. Power is demonstrated through existing rights that give the Group the ability to direct activities that significantly affect the entity’s returns. The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the elements of control listed above. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.', '2.12.2 Associates  Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.  Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Equity accounting involves recording the investment in associates initially at cost, and recognising the Group’s share of the post-acquisition results of associates in the consolidated income statement, and the Group’s share of post-acquisition reserve movements in reserves. The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investments in the consolidated statement of financial position.  Where the Group’s interest in an associate reduces as a result of a deemed disposal, any gain or loss arising as a result of the deemed disposal is taken to the consolidated income statement. Where the Group increases its interest in its existing associate and it remains as an associate, the incremental cost of investment is added to the existing carrying amount without considering the fair value of the associate’s identifiable assets and liabilities. In the consolidated statement of financial position, investments in associates include goodwill on acquisition identified on acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 2001, net of accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is assessed for impairment as part of the investment in associates. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, including loans that are in fact extensions of the Group’s investment, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred or guaranteed obligations in respect of the associate. Unrealised gains resulting from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.', '2.12.3 Joint ventures Joint ventures are joint arrangements whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have  rights to the net assets of the joint arrangements. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing the control.  The Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Where the Group’s interest in a joint venture reduces as a result of a deemed disposal, any gain or loss arising as a result of the deemed disposal is taken to the consolidated income statement.', '151', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.12.3 Joint ventures (Cont’d) Where the Group increases its interest in its existing joint venture and it remains as a joint venture, the incremental cost of investment is added to the existing carrying amount without considering the fair value of the joint venture’s identifiable assets and liabilities. In the consolidated statement of financial position, investments in joint ventures include goodwill on acquisition identified on acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 2001, net of accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is assessed for impairment as part of the investment in joint ventures. The Group’s interest in its unincorporated joint operations is accounted for by recognising the Group’s assets and liabilities from the joint operations, as well as expenses incurred by the Group and the Group’s share of income earned from the joint operations, in the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains resulting from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the joint venture. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.', '2.12.4 Dividends from associates and joint ventures  Dividends are recognised when the Group’s rights to receive payment have been established. Dividends received from an associate or joint venture in excess of the Group’s carrying value of the equity accounted investee are recognised as dividend income in the consolidated income statement where there is no legal or constructive obligation to refund the dividend nor is there any commitment to provide financial support to the investee. Equity accounting is then suspended until the investee has made sufficient profits to cover the income previously recognised for the excess cash distributions. ', '2.12.5 Structured entity The Trust has been consolidated in the consolidated financial statements under SFRS(I) 10, Consolidated  Financial Statements.', '2.12.6 Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method on and after 1 April 2010. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred and equity interests issued by the Group and any contingent consideration arrangement at acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity, are expensed as incurred.  Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in the consolidated income statement. For business combinations that are achieved in stages, any existing equity interests in the acquiree entity  are re-measured to their fair values at acquisition date and any changes are taken to the consolidated  income statement.', 'Singapore Telecommunications Limited  |  Annual Report 2019 152', 'OVERVIEW', 'BU', 'SINESS R', 'EVIEWS', 'GO', 'VERN', 'AN', 'CE A', 'ND SUSTA', 'INA', 'BILITY', 'PERFO', 'RM', 'AN', 'CE', 'FINA', 'NC', 'IALS', 'AD', 'DITIO', 'NA', 'L INFO', 'RM', 'ATION', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.12.6 Business combinations (Cont’d) Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries represent the equity in subsidiaries which are not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the shareholders of the Company, and are presented separately in the consolidated statement  of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and within equity in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Group elects for each individual business combination whether non-controlling interests in the acquiree entity are recognised at fair value, or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate  share of the fair value of the acquiree entity’s identifiable net assets, at the acquisition date.  Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests based on their respective interests in a subsidiary, even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a debit balance.  Changes in the Group’s interest in subsidiaries that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as  equity transactions.  When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, any interest retained in the former subsidiary is recorded at fair value with the re-measurement gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income statement. ', '2.13 Investments in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures  In the Company’s statement of financial position, investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, including loans that meet the definition of equity instruments, are stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Where an indication of impairment exists, the carrying amount of the investment is assessed and written down immediately to its recoverable value. On disposal of investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the investment is recognised in the income statement of the Company.', '2.14 Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income (“FVOCI”) investments On initial recognition, the Group has made an irrevocable election to designate all equity investments (other than investments in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures) as FVOCI investments as these are strategic investments held for the long term. They are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs, with subsequent changes in fair value and translation differences recognised in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ and accumulated within ‘Fair Value Reserve’ in equity. Upon disposal, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is transferred to retained earnings and is not reclassified to the income statement. Dividends are recognised in the income statement when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.  Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the investment.', '2.15 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities The Group enters into the following derivative financial instruments to hedge its risks, namely – Cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps as fair value hedges for interest rate risk and cash flow hedges for currency risk arising from the Group’s issued bonds. The swaps involve the exchange of principal and floating or fixed interest receipts in the foreign currency in which the issued bonds are denominated, for principal and floating or fixed interest payments in the entities’ functional currencies. Forward foreign exchange contracts as cash flow hedges for the Group’s exposure to foreign currency exchange risks arising from forecasted or committed expenditure.', '153', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.15 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities (Cont’d) Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair values at the end of each reporting period.  A derivative financial instrument is carried as an asset when the fair value is positive and as a liability when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they qualify for hedge accounting.', '2.15.1 Hedge accounting At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with the risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. At inception and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting the changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. To be effective, the hedging relationships are to meet all of the following requirements:(i) there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument;(ii) the effect of credit risk does not dominate the fair value changes that result from that economic relationship; and(iii) the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group uses to hedge that quantity of the hedged item.  If a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to the hedge ratio but the risk management objective for that designated hedging relationship remains the same, the Group adjusts the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship (i.e. rebalances the hedge) so that it meets the qualifying criteria again. The Group designates the full change in the fair value of a forward currency contract (i.e. including the forwards elements) as the hedged risk for all its hedging relationships involving forward currency contracts. Note 18.1 sets out the details of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. Fair value hedge Designated derivative financial instruments that qualify for fair value hedge accounting are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into. Changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded in the income statement together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged items that are attributable to the hedged risks.  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. The adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is amortised in the income statement from that date.

The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Amounts accumulated in the ‘Hedging Reserve’ within equity are transferred to the income statement in the periods when the hedged items affect the income statement. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gain or loss previously recognised in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ and accumulated in equity are removed from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. This transfer does not affect ‘Other Comprehensive Income’. Furthermore, if the Group expects some or all the loss accumulated in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’ will not be recovered in the future, that amount is immediately reclassified to the income statement.  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.

In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability which market participants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  The following methods and assumptions are used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument – Bank balances, receivables and payables, current borrowings The carrying amounts approximate fair values due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Quoted and unquoted investments The fair values of investments traded in active markets are based on the market quoted price or the price quoted by the market maker at the close of business at the end of the reporting period.  The fair values of unquoted investments are determined primarily using recent arm’s length transactions. Cross currency and interest rate swaps The fair value of a cross currency or an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the swap contract can be exchanged for or settled with under normal market conditions. This fair value can be estimated using the discounted cash flow method where the future cash flows of the swap contract are discounted at the prevailing market foreign exchange rates and interest rates. Market interest rates are actively quoted interest rates or interest rates computed by applying techniques to these actively quoted interest rates.', '155', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.16 Fair Value Estimation of Financial Instruments (Cont’d)', 'Forward foreign currency contracts The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles at the end of the reporting period.', 'Non-current borrowings For disclosure purposes, the fair values of non-current borrowings which are traded in active markets are based on the quoted market ask price.

A bargain purchase gain is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement. Gains or losses on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures include the carrying amount of capitalised goodwill relating to the entity sold.', '2.19.2 Other intangible assets Expenditure on telecommunication and spectrum licences are capitalised and amortised using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 11 to 16 years.  Other intangible assets which are acquired in business combinations are carried at fair values at the date of acquisition, and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the expected benefits. Customer relationships or customer contracts, brand, and technology have estimated useful lives of 4 to 10 years. Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. ', '2.20 Impairment of Non-Financial Assets Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is subject to an annual impairment test or is more frequently tested for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired. Goodwill is not amortised  (see Note 2.19.1). Other intangible assets of the Group, which have finite useful lives and are subject to amortisation, as well as property, plant and equipment and investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, are reviewed at the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indicator for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the assets’ recoverable amounts are estimated.  For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units). An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.  An impairment loss for an asset, other than goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries, is reversed if, and only if, there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. Impairment loss on goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is not reversed.', '2.21 Non-current Assets (or Disposal Groups) Held For Sale Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified as assets held for sale and stated at the lower of their carrying amounts and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amounts are recovered principally through sale transactions rather than through continuing use.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issuance of new equity shares are taken to equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.   When the Company purchases its own equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable costs, is recognised as ‘Treasury Shares’ within equity. When the shares are subsequently disposed, the realised gains or losses on disposal of the treasury shares are included in ‘Other Reserves’ of the Company. The Trust acquires shares in the Company from the open market for delivery to employees upon vesting of performance shares awarded under Singtel performance share plans. Such shares are designated as ‘Treasury Shares’. In the consolidated financial statements, the cost of unvested shares, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as ‘Treasury Shares’ within equity.  Upon vesting of the performance shares, the weighted average costs of the shares delivered to employees, whether held by the Company or the Trust, are transferred to ‘Capital Reserve’ within equity in the financial statements.', '2.23 Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognised when the Group satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a promised good or service to the customer. It is measured based on the amount of the transaction price allocated to the satisfied performance obligation, and are net of goods and services tax, rebates, discounts and sales within  the Group. Revenue from service contracts (e.g. telecommunications or pay TV) are recognised ratably over the contract  periods as control over the services passes to the customers as services are provided. Service revenue is also recognised based on usage (e.g. minutes of traffic/ bytes of data). For prepaid cards which have been sold, revenue is recognised based on usage. A contract liability is recognised for advance payments received from customers where services have not been rendered as at the end of the reporting period. Expenses directly attributable to the unearned revenue are deferred until the revenue is recognised. Revenue from the sale of equipment (primarily handsets and accessories) is recognised upon the transfer of control to the customer or third party dealer which generally coincides with delivery and acceptance of the equipment sold.  Goods and services deliverable under bundled telecommunication contracts are identified as separate performance obligations to the extent that the customer can benefit from the goods or services on their own. The transaction price is allocated between goods and services based on their relative standalone selling prices. Standalone selling prices are determined by assessing prices paid for standalone equipment and for service-only contracts (e.g. arrangements where customers bring their own equipment). Where standalone selling prices are not directly observable, estimation techniques are used.  Contracts with customers generally do not include a material right. In cases where material rights are granted such as the award of mobile price plan discount vouchers, a portion of the transaction price is deferred as a contract liability (see Note 2.7) and is not recognised as revenue until this additional performance obligation has been satisfied or has lapsed. Incentives given to customers are recognised as a reduction from revenue in accordance with the specific terms  and conditions of each contract.', '159', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.23 Revenue Recognition (Cont’d) Non-refundable, upfront service activation and setup fees associated with service arrangements are deferred and recognised over the associated service contract period or customer life. The Group may exchange network capacity with other capacity or service providers. The exchange is regarded as a transaction which generates revenue unless the transaction lacks commercial substance or the fair value of neither the capacity received nor the capacity given up is reliably measurable.  When the Group has control of goods or services prior to delivery to a customer, the Group is the principal in the sale to the customer. If another party has control of goods and services prior to transfer to a customer, then the Group is acting as an agent for the other party and revenue is recognised net of any related payments. The Group typically acts as an agent for digital mobile content such as music and video. For information technology projects, revenue is recognised over time based on the cost-to-cost method, i.e. based on the proportion of contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs, while invoicing is typically based on milestones. A contract asset is recognised for work performed. Any amount previously recognised as a contract asset is transferred to trade receivable upon invoicing to the customer.  If the milestone payment exceeds the revenue recognised to date, then the Group recognises a contract liability  for the difference. Revenues from sale of perpetual software licences and the related hardware are recognised when title passes to  the customer, generally upon delivery. Revenues from digital advertising services and solutions are recognised when advertising services are delivered, and when digital advertising impressions are delivered or click-throughs occur. Revenue from sale of advertising space is recognised when the advertising space is filled and sold to customers. The Group is generally the principal in transactions carried out through Amobee’s advertising platforms and therefore reports gross revenue based on the amount billed to customers. Dividend income is recorded gross in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established. Interest income is recognised on a time proportion basis using the effective interest method. Revenue recognition for leases is described in Note 2.24.2.

Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in ‘Other Comprehensive Income’. The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the income statement as it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or tax deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate, at the end of the reporting period. Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the end of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit/ loss, it is not recognised. Deferred income tax is also not recognised for goodwill which is not deductible for tax purposes. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates (and tax laws) enacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate, at the end of the reporting period. Deferred tax liabilities are provided on all taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unutilised tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused losses can be utilised.', '163', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '2.30 Income Tax (Cont’d) At the end of each reporting period, the Group re-assesses unrecognised deferred tax assets and the carrying amount of deferred tax assets.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGEMENTS The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom be equal to the future actual results. As accounting standards are principles-based, professional judgement is required under certain circumstances. The estimates, assumptions and judgements that bear a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are  discussed below.', '3.1 Impairment Reviews The accounting policies for impairment of non-financial assets are stated in Note 2.20. During an impairment review, the Group assesses whether the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In making this judgement, the Group evaluates the value-in-use which is supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from such assets or cash-generating units using cash flow projections which have been discounted at an appropriate rate. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on the Group’s estimates using historical, sector and industry trends, general market and  economic conditions, changes in technology and other available information.

The impairment assessment requires the exercise of significant judgement about future market conditions, including growth rates and discount rates applicable in a number of markets where the associates and joint ventures operate.  The assumptions used by management to determine the value-in-use calculations of goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 24. The carrying values of joint ventures and associates including goodwill capitalised are stated in Note 22 and Note 23 respectively. ', '3.2 Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”) of Receivables At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether trade and other receivables are credit-impaired. The allowance for ECL is based on management’s assessment of the collectability of individual customer accounts taking into consideration the credit worthiness and financial condition of those customers. The Group also records an allowance for all other receivables based on management’s collective assessment of their collectability taking into consideration multiple factors including historical experience of credit losses, forward looking information as applicable and the aging of the receivables with allowances generally increasing as the receivable ages. If there is a deterioration of customers’ financial condition or if future default rates in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Group may have to adjust the allowance for credit losses, which would affect earnings in the  period that adjustments are made. The exposure to credit risk for receivables is disclosed in Note 16.', '3.3 Estimated Useful Lives of Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment balances represent a significant component of the Group’s assets. Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Group reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment on an annual basis based on factors such as business plans and strategies, expected level of usage and future technological developments. It is possible that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in these estimates brought about by changes in the factors mentioned above. A reduction in the estimated useful lives would increase the recorded depreciation and decrease the carrying value of property, plant and equipment.', '3.4 Taxation 3.4.1 Deferred tax asset The Group reviews the carrying amount of deferred tax assets at each reporting date. A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. This involves judgement regarding the future financial performance of the particular legal entity or tax group for which the deferred tax asset has been recognised. ', '3.4.2 Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is involved in determining the group-wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business, including the tax matters disclosed in Note 40(b). The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. ', '165', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '3.5 Fair values of derivative financial instruments The Group uses valuation techniques to determine the fair values of financial instruments. The valuation techniques used for different financial instruments are selected to reflect how the market would be expected to price the instruments, using inputs that reasonably reflect the risk-return factors inherent in the instruments. Depending upon the characteristics of the financial instruments, observable market factors are available for use in most valuations, while others involve a greater degree of judgment and estimation.', '3.6 Share-based Payments Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant, whereas cash-settled share-based payments are measured at current fair value at the end of each reporting period. In addition, the Group revises the estimated number of equity instruments that participants are expected to receive based on non-market vesting conditions at the end of each reporting period. The Group uses expert valuation services to determine the fair values. The assumptions of the valuation model used to determine fair values are set out in Note 5.3.', '3.7 Contingent Liabilities The Group consults with its legal counsel on matters related to litigation, and other experts both within and  outside the Group with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business. As at 31 March 2019, the Group was involved in various legal proceedings where it has been vigorously defending its claims as disclosed in Note 40. Assessment on whether the risk of loss is remote, possible or probable requires significant judgement given the complexities involved. The Group’s associates and joint ventures also report significant contingent liabilities. The significant contingent liabilities of the Group’s associates and joint ventures are disclosed in Note 41. ', '3.8 Revenue Recognition  The accounting policies for revenue recognition are stated in Note 2.23. The application of SFRS(I) 15 requires the Group to exercise judgement in identifying distinct or non-distinct performance obligations. For bundled telecommunications contracts, the Group is required to estimate the standalone selling prices of performance obligations, which materially impacts the allocation of revenue between performance obligations. Where the Group does not sell equivalent goods or services in similar circumstances on a standalone basis, it is necessary to estimate the standalone selling price. Changes in estimates of standalone selling prices can significantly influence the allocation of the transaction price between performance obligations. When estimating the standalone selling price, the Group maximises the use of observable inputs. The assessment of whether the Group presents operating revenue as the principal, or net after deduction of costs as an agent, is a matter of judgement which requires an analysis of both the legal form and the substance of contracts. Depending on the conclusion reached, there may be material differences in the amounts of revenues and expenses, though there is no impact on profit.', 'Singapore Telecommunications Limited  |  Annual Report 2019 166', 'OVERVIEW', 'BU', 'SINESS R', 'EVIEWS', 'GO', 'VERN', 'AN', 'CE A', 'ND SUSTA', 'INA', 'BILITY', 'PERFO', 'RM', 'AN', 'CE', 'FINA', 'NC', 'IALS', 'AD', 'DITIO', 'NA', 'L INFO', 'RM', 'ATION', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '4.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEWS Goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries  The carrying values of the Group’s goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries as at 31 March 2019 were assessed for impairment during the financial year.  Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to the individual entity which is also the cash-generating  unit (“CGU”).  The Group is structured into three business segments, Group Consumer, Group Enterprise and Group Digital Life. Based on the relative fair value approach, the goodwill of Optus was fully allocated to Consumer Australia included in the Group Consumer segment for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing. The recoverable values of cash-generating units including goodwill are determined based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculations apply a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by management. The Group has used cash flow projections of five years except for Amobee and the Global Cyber Security business which were based on cash flow projections of thirteen years and ten years respectively to better reflect their stages of growth. Cash flows beyond the terminal year are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated in the table below. Key assumptions used in the calculation of value-in-use are growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditure and discount rates. The terminal growth rates used do not exceed the long term average growth rates of the respective industry and country in which the entity operates and are consistent with forecasts included in industry reports.  The discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are based on Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) where the cost of a company’s debt and equity capital are weighted to reflect its capital structure.

Singtel sold its 100% interest in NLT to NetLink NBN Trust (the “Trust”) in July 2017 for cash as well as a 24.8% interest in the Trust. Net deferred gains of S$1.10 billion were correspondingly released to the Group’s income statement in the previous financial year upon this sale.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES', '36.1  Financial Risk Factors The Group’s activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk. The Group’s overall risk management seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects of these risks on the financial performance of the Group. The Group uses financial instruments such as currency forwards, cross currency and interest rate swaps, and foreign currency borrowings to hedge certain financial risk exposures. No financial derivatives are held or sold for speculative purposes. The Directors assume responsibility for the overall financial risk management of the Group. For the financial year ended 31 March 2019, the Risk Committee and Finance and Investment Committee (“FIC”), which are committees of the Board, assisted the Directors in reviewing and establishing policies relating to financial risk management in accordance with the policies and directives of the Directors.', '36.2  Foreign Exchange Risk The foreign exchange risk of the Group arises from subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures operating in foreign countries, mainly Australia, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and the United States of America. Additionally, the Group’s joint venture in India, Bharti Airtel Limited, is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risks from its operations in Sri Lanka and 14 countries across Africa. Translation risks of overseas net investments are not hedged unless approved by the FIC.  The Group has borrowings denominated in foreign currencies that have primarily been hedged into the functional currency of the respective borrowing entities using cross currency swaps in order to reduce the foreign currency exposure on these borrowings. As the hedges are intended to be perfect, any change in the fair value of the cross currency swaps has minimal impact on profit and equity.  The Group Treasury Policy, as approved by the FIC, is to substantially hedge all known transactional currency exposures. The Group generates revenue, receives foreign dividends and incurs costs in currencies which are other than the functional currencies of the operating units, thus giving rise to foreign exchange risk. The currency exposures are primarily for the Australian Dollar, Euro, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Indonesian Rupiah, Philippine Peso, Pound Sterling, Thai Baht, United States Dollar and Japanese Yen.  Foreign currency purchases and forward currency contracts are used to reduce the Group’s transactional exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The foreign exchange difference on trade balances is disclosed under Note 6 and the foreign exchange difference on non-trade balances is disclosed under Note 10.', 'Singapore Telecommunications Limited  |  Annual Report 2019 224', 'OVERVIEW', 'BU', 'SINESS R', 'EVIEWS', 'GO', 'VERN', 'AN', 'CE A', 'ND SUSTA', 'INA', 'BILITY', 'PERFO', 'RM', 'AN', 'CE', 'FINA', 'NC', 'IALS', 'AD', 'DITIO', 'NA', 'L INFO', 'RM', 'ATION', 'Notes to the Financial StatementsFor the financial year ended 31 March 2019', '36.2  Foreign Exchange Risk (Cont’d) The critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, maturity and underlying) of the derivative financial instruments and  their corresponding hedged items are the same. The Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness  and it is expected that derivative financial instruments and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying exchange rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and the  Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the derivative financial instruments, which is not reflected in the  fair value of the hedged items attributable to changes in foreign currency rates. No other source of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. All hedge relationships remain effective and there is no hedge relationship in which hedge accounting is no  longer applied.', '36.3 Interest Rate Risk The Group has cash balances placed with reputable banks and financial institutions which generate interest  income for the Group. The Group manages its interest rate risks on its interest income by placing the cash balances on varying maturities and interest rate terms. The Group’s borrowings include bank borrowings and bonds. The borrowings expose the Group to interest rate risk. The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to these risks by entering into interest rate swaps over the duration of its borrowings. Interest rate swaps entail the Group agreeing to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. As at 31 March 2019, after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps, approximately 66%  (31 March 2018: 67%) of the Group’s borrowings were at fixed rates of interest. As at 31 March 2019, assuming that the market interest rate is 50 basis points higher or lower and with no change  to the other variables, the annualised interest expense on borrowings would be higher or lower by S$15.4 million (2018: S$15.5 million).  The critical terms (i.e. the notional amount, maturity and underlying) of the derivative financial instruments and their corresponding hedged items are the same. The Group performs a qualitative assessment of effectiveness and it is expected that derivative financial instruments and the value of the corresponding hedged items will systematically change in opposite direction in response to movements in the underlying interest rates. The main source of hedge ineffectiveness in these hedging relationships is the effect of the counterparty and  the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swaps, which is not reflected in the fair value of the hedge items attributable to changes in interest rates. No other source of ineffectiveness emerged from these hedging relationships. Interest rate swap contracts paying fixed rate interest amounts are designated and effective as cash flow hedges in reducing the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (a) Airtel, a joint venture of the Group, has disputes with various government authorities in the respective jurisdictions where its operations are based, as well as with third parties regarding certain transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business.  On 8 January 2013, the local regulator, Department of Telecommunications (“DOT”) issued a demand on Airtel Group for Rs. 52.01 billion (S$1.02 billion) towards levy of one time spectrum charge, which was further revised on 27 June 2018 to Rs. 84.14 billion (S$1.65 billion).  In the opinion of Airtel, inter-alia, the above demand amounts to alteration of the terms of the licences issued in the past. Airtel believes, based on independent legal opinion and its evaluation, that it is not probable that any material part of the claim will be awarded against Airtel and therefore, pending outcome of this matter, no provision has been recognised.  As at 31 March 2019, other taxes, custom duties and demands under adjudication, appeal or disputes amounted to approximately Rs. 166 billion (S$3.25 billion). In respect of some of the tax issues, pending final decisions, Airtel had deposited amounts with statutory authorities.(b) AIS, a joint venture of the Group, has various commercial disputes and significant litigations.  In 2008, CAT Telecom Public Company Limited (“CAT”) demanded that AIS’ subsidiary, Digital Phone  Company Limited (“DPC”) pay additional revenue share of THB 3.4 billion (S$146 million) arising from the abolishment of excise tax. CAT’s claim is still pending appeal before the Supreme Administrative Court. In 2015, TOT Public Company Limited (“TOT”) demanded that AIS pays additional revenue share of  THB 62.8 billion (S$2.68 billion) arising from what TOT claims to be an illegality of two amendments made to the Concession Agreement, namely, Amendment 6 (regarding reduction in prepaid revenue share rate) made in 2001 and Amendment 7 (regarding deduction of roaming expense from revenue share) made in 2002, which have resulted in lower revenue share. This case is pending arbitration. Between 2011 and 2016, TOT demanded that AIS pays additional revenue share based on gross interconnection income from 2007 to 2015 amounting to THB 36.2 billion (S$1.55 billion) plus interest. On 17 August 2018, the Arbitration Institute awarded in favour of AIS in deciding that TOT has no right to claim for revenue share on gross interconnection income for the period from 2007 to 2010 amounting to THB 17.8 billion (S$760 million). The claims for the remaining period from 2011 to 2015 amounting to THB 18.4 billion (S$784 million) are pending arbitration. Between 2014 to 2016, TOT demanded that AIS pays THB 41.1 billion (S$1.76 billion) plus interest for the porting of subscribers from 900 MHz to 2100 MHz network.

SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT LIABILITIES OF ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES (Cont’d) In March 2018, CAT demanded DPC to transfer the telecommunications systems which would have been supplied under the Concession Agreement between CAT and DPC of THB 13.4 billion (S$573 million) or to pay the same amount plus interest. This case is pending arbitration. In September 2018, TOT demanded that AIS pays additional revenue share from disputes on roaming rates from July 2013 to September 2015, amounting to THB 16.3 billion (S$694 million).  As at 31 March 2019, there are a number of other claims against AIS and its subsidiaries amounting to  ', 'THB 30.1 billion (S$1.28 billion) which are pending adjudication. AIS believes that the above claims will be settled in favour of AIS and will have no material impact to its financial statements.(c) In October 2017, Intouch and its subsidiary, Thaicom Public Company Limited (“Thaicom”) received letters from the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (the “Ministry”) stating that Thaicom 7 and Thaicom 8 satellites (the “Satellites”) are governed under the terms of a 1991 satellite operating agreement between Intouch and the Ministry which entails the transfer of asset ownership, procurement of backup satellites, payment of revenue share, and procurement of property insurance. Intouch and Thaicom have obtained legal advice and are of the opinion that the Satellites are not covered under the Agreement but instead under the licence from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission. This case is pending arbitration.(d) Globe, a joint venture of the Group, is contingently liable for various claims arising in the ordinary conduct of business and certain tax assessments which are either pending decision by the Courts or are being contested, the outcome of which are not presently determinable. In the opinion of Globe’s management and legal counsel, the eventual liability under these claims, if any, will not have a material or adverse effect on Globe’s financial position and results of operations. In June 2016, the Philippine Competition Commission (“PCC”) claimed that the Joint Notice of Acquisition filed by Globe, PLDT Inc. (“PLDT”) and San Miguel Corporation (“SMC”) on the acquisition of SMC’s telecommunications business was deficient and cannot be claimed to be deemed approved. In July 2016, Globe filed a petition with the Court of Appeals of the Philippines (“CA”) to stop the PCC from reviewing the acquisition. In October 2017, the CA ruled in favour of Globe and PLDT, and declared the acquisition as valid and deemed approved. PCC subsequently elevated the case to the Supreme Court to review the CA’s rulings.(e) As at 31 March 2019, Telkomsel, a joint venture of the Group, has filed appeals and cross-appeals amounting to approximately IDR 71 billion (S$7 million) for various tax claims arising in certain tax assessments which are pending final decisions, the outcome of which is not presently determinable.

EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED  The new and revised accounting standards effective from 1 April 2019 are not expected to have a significant impact on the financial statements of the Group in the next financial year ending 31 March 2020 except for  SFRS(I) 16, Leases.  SFRS(I) 16 requires lessees to adopt a single lease accounting model with leases recognised as lease liabilities in the statement of financial position, with corresponding “right-of-use” assets. In the income statement, depreciation charges on the “right-of-use” assets and interest expense on the lease liability will be recorded. In the statement of cash flows, lease payments will be classified as financing cash flows. The new standard also specifies new accounting rules for sales and leaseback of assets, as well as for subleases of leased assets under certain circumstances. The standard continues to adopt a dual accounting lease model for lessor accounting. The Group will apply SFRS(I) 16 using the modified retrospective approach where the cumulative effect of initial application will be reflected as an adjustment to the opening statement of financial position as at 1 April 2019. The standard will be applied prospectively with no restatement of financial statements for the comparative periods.  On transition, the Group will elect the practical expedients permitted by the new standard, including carrying forward the historical lease classification, as well as excluding all leases with original maturities of one year or less, and leases of low value assets.  The Group is a lessee mainly for operating leases of facilities such as central offices, data centres, corporate offices, retail stores, network equipment, ducts and manholes.  In Australia, the Group sells and leases back handsets (as a lessee) from a bank for subleasing to its customers  (as an intermediate lessor). Before the adoption of SFRS(I) 16, the profit on sale of handset is accounted in full upon delivery, the lease payments made (as a lessee) are accounted as operating lease expenses over the  contract period, and the lease income received (as an intermediate lessor) are recognised as operating lease income over the contract period. Under SFRS(I) 16, however, the profit on sale and leaseback of handset to be recognised is subject to the proportion attributable to the bank and an upfront gain or loss on finance lease of leased handsets will be recognised. The Group is still in the process of quantifying the impact of SFRS(I) 16 on the financial statements.', '44.
